**Question:** How can I login in the app?

**Answer:** You've got to first create an account on [BoxTech Global Container Database](https://app.bic-boxtech.org/login) so that you gonna be able to login at the app and behind the scenes, we gonna provide a BoxTech JWT token to allow you to get shipping containers information through the BoxTech Global Container Database [API](https://bic-boxtech.github.io/BIC-Boxtech-API-documentation/index.html).

##
**Question:** What is BoxTech?

**Answer:** BoxTech is a non-profit service operated by the [Bureau International des Containers](https://www.bic-code.org/) â€“ a non-profit organization serving the container transportation industry. 
BoxTech allows shippers, forwarders and other stakeholders to access a single database, eliminating the need to either visit multiple websites to obtain the tare weight data or to obtain this information from the weight indicated on the door of each container.
Feel free to find more information through their official [website](https://www.bic-boxtech.org/).

##
**Question:** What is BoxTech Global Container Database?

**Answer:** The BoxTech Global Container Database is a neutral, centralized data repository providing container owners and users a platform to easily exchange container fleet technical details. BoxTech provides an easy-to-access source of container characteristics to help support carriers, shippers, forwarders and other stakeholders in the supply chain. 

##
**Question:** Is this app running for IOS?

**Answer:** Not yet. Just for Android at the moment.

##
**Question:** What does ISO 6346 mean?

**Answer:** [ISO 6346](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6346) is an international standard covering the coding, identification and marking of shipping containers. The standard establishes a visual identification system for every container that includes a unique serial number (with [check digit](https://www.bic-code.org/check-digit-calculator/)), the owner, a country code, a size, type and equipment category as well as any operational marks. The standard is managed by the [International Container Bureau (BIC)](https://www.bic-code.org/).
